AWS Data Pipeline ingests raw data to S3, triggers SNSâ†’SQS for reliable delivery, and ETL Lambda runs Glue jobs to clean/transform into Parquet in target S3. A Crawler Lambda updates Glue Catalog for Athena queries. DLQ &amp; CloudWatch monitor errors, while EventBridge + PagerDuty + Slack provide real-time alerts and observability.
